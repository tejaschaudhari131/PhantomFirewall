PhantomFirewall is an intelligent, adaptive firewall system that leverages machine learning to provide dynamic traffic filtering based on user behavior patterns and real-time threat intelligence.

## Features

- **Adaptive Traffic Analysis**: Uses machine learning to understand normal network patterns and detect anomalies
- **Behavioral Learning**: Continuously adapts to user and application behavior patterns
- **Real-time Threat Intelligence**: Integration with multiple threat feeds for up-to-date protection
- **Custom Rule Engine**: Flexible rule creation system with both preset and user-defined rules
- **Performance Optimization**: Lightweight implementation with minimal system impact
- **Dashboard Interface**: Web-based UI for monitoring and configuration
- **API Support**: RESTful API for integration with other security tools
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive logging system with customizable verbosity

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/phantomfirewall.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd phantomfirewall

# Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install the package
python setup.py install
```

## Quick Start

1. Start the firewall service:
```bash
phantom-firewall start
```

2. Access the web dashboard:
```bash
http://localhost:8080
```

3. Configure your initial ruleset:
```bash
phantom-firewall config --import default-rules.yaml
```

## Configuration

PhantomFirewall can be configured through either the web dashboard or YAML configuration files. Here's a basic configuration example:

```yaml
phantom:
  mode: adaptive
  learning_rate: 0.01
  threat_feeds:
    - name: "AlienVault OTX"
      enabled: true
      update_interval: 3600
    - name: "AbuseIPDB"
      enabled: true
      update_interval: 7200
  
  rules:
    - name: "Block Known Malicious IPs"
      priority: 1
      action: "DROP"
      
    - name: "Allow HTTPS Traffic"
      priority: 2
      protocol: "TCP"
      port: 443
      action: "ACCEPT"
```

## Architecture

PhantomFirewall consists of several key components:

1. **Core Engine**: Handles packet inspection and rule application
2. **ML Module**: Processes network behavior and adapts filtering rules
3. **Threat Intelligence Manager**: Updates and maintains threat data
4. **API Server**: Provides REST API for external integration
5. **Web Dashboard**: User interface for configuration and monitoring

## API Reference

The REST API provides programmatic access to all firewall features:

```bash
# Get current status
GET /api/v1/status

# Update rules
POST /api/v1/rules

# Fetch threat intelligence
GET /api/v1/threats
```

Full API documentation is available at `/api/docs`.

## Performance Considerations

PhantomFirewall is designed to be lightweight while maintaining effective protection:

- Memory Usage: ~50-100MB base footprint
- CPU Usage: 2-5% under normal conditions
- Network Impact: <1ms added latency
- Learning Phase: Initial 24-48 hours for behavioral baseline

## Security Considerations

- Regular updates are crucial for threat intelligence accuracy
- Default rules provide basic protection but should be customized
- Enable logging for security auditing
- Review ML model decisions periodically
